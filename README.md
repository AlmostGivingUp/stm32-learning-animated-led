# stm32-learning-animated-led
A beginner STM32 project to learn interrupts, UART communication, and non-blocking design.

Learned:
1. Blocking and non-blocking code
2. Using USART RX interrupts and TX
3. Pausing execution safely
4. Abstracting HAL functions using OOP
5. Executing code in CPP instead of C
6. Using interrupts

How to build/run:
1. Press the "Play" button on the top bar in STM32CubeIDE, which allows the code to be built and executed on the STM32 development board.
2. Press SWITCH for Animation 1 and BUTTON for Animation 2
3. Download CoolTerm (for MacOS) or equivalent
4. Enter 'p' to pause the animation, and 'r' to resume the animation.
